    <h1>In this project I learned how to display images in different projections</h1>
    
    <h2 style="color:red">Describe in your own words how you displayed the map in different projections using QGIS</h2>
    <p>To display the different map projections in QGIS I used the Indicatrix plugin to show how each projection warped the map. Then I changed the projections of the map by clicking in the bottom right corner and selecting which projection I wanted to change to</p>
    
    <h2>WGS84 Projection</h2>
    <h3>This projection keeps the direction of the map but changes the size and shape of the land around the poles.</h3>
    <a href=".//maps/4326.png">
    <img src=".//maps/4326.png" alt="WGS84" width='500px'>
    </a>
    <h2>Aitoff Projection</h2>
    <h3>This projection has changes in shape, direction, and size of land to create a balanced map. It does this by being an oval map as opposed to a rectangle map.</h3>
    <a href=".//maps/54043.png">
    <img src=".//maps/54043.png" alt="Aitoff" width='500px'>
    </a>
    <h2>EPSG3857 Projection</h2>
    <h3>This map keeps shape and direction but has large size changes. The land near the poles is much bigger than the land near the equator. Also, Antartica is massive and extends below the map.</h3>
    <a href=".//maps/3857.png">
    <img src=".//maps/3857.png" alt="WGS84" width='500px'>
    </a>
    <h2>ESRI53018 Projection</h2>
    <h3>This projection also balances size, shape, and distance but to a different degree than the Aitoff projection. It is flat on the top and bottom but oval shaped on the sides.</h3>
    <a href=".//maps/53018.png">
    <img src=".//maps/53018.png" alt="WGS84" width='500px'>
    </a>
    <h2>ESRI54034 Projection</h2>
    <h3>This projection keeps the size and direction of land but heavily changes the shape. Countries around the poles are the correct size but are squished and distorted to fit onto a rectangular map.</h3>
    <a href=".//maps/54034.png">
    <img src=".//maps/54034.png" alt="WGS84" width='500px'>
    </a>
    <h2>ESRI54027 Projection</h2>
    <h3>This projection is cone shaped with large amounts of distortaion in size and shape around the south pole. The north pole and majority of land masses surrounding it are the correct size and shape with some changes in distance.</h3>
    <a href=".//maps/54027.png">
    <img src=".//maps/54027.png" alt="WGS84" width='500px'>
    </a>
    <h2>ESRI102016 Projection</h2>
    <h3>This is a full circle shape with distortaion of size shape and direction around the south pole. This leaves the land surround the north pole less distorted in all categories.</h3>
    <a href=".//maps/102016.png">
    <img src=".//maps/102016.png" alt="WGS84" width='500px'>
    </a>
    <h2 style="color:red">Now, you should <u>add the following projections on your own:</u></h2>
    <h3>EPSG: 3857, 53018, 54034, 54027, 102016, and two additional projections that you choose.</h3>
</a>
    <h2>ESRI54029 Projection</h2>
    <h3>This projection is circular shaped with a flat top and bottom. The size, shape, and direction are kept the same around the center but get more distorted around the corners. This causes the poles and land in the corners of the map to be pretty distorted in comparison to the middle.</h3>
    <a href=".//maps/54029.png">
    <img src=".//maps/54029.png" alt="WGS84" width='500px'>
    </a>
    <h2>ESPG28485 Projection</h2>
    <h3>This projection has a very strange shape that I can't even really describe well. The direction seems to be warped into a circle shape aswell as stretched into long shapes. The land masses are also jumbled up and confusing. I am not sure what this projection would be used for.</h3>
