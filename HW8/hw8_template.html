    <p>My map answers the question of what public schools in Florida are within a 20 KM range of a hospital. <br> I figured this would be an important question to ask because people would want their childrens school to be near a <br> hospital in case of an emergency. With my map people can view what schools are in safe zones <br> and which ones aren't.</p>
